    "Let us consider the first scenario where we have a device which could be used to distinguish non-orthogonal quantum states. This implies that given an arbitrary quantum state $a\\vert0\n",
    "\\rangle + b\\vert1\\rangle$, it will be able to identify amplitude **a** and **b** both, without destroying the system upon a single measurement. Then, we can prepare states based on the amplitudes a and b as many times as we like. This is a clear violation of quantum no-cloing theorem.   \n",

Then using this device, we will create a clone of an arbitrary state $a\\vert0\\rangle + b\\vert1\\rangle$ and then measure it in both $a\\vert0\\rangle$ and $b\\vert1\\rangle$ basis to measure their respective amplitudes. \n"
